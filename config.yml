              Content: "Hello, welsome to my amaro course! The goal of this site is to offer employees of the service industry a brief introductionâ€”or quick refresherâ€”on the world of amaro. It is my hope that this webpage will server as a ten-minute crash course for anyone in the service industry who wants to learn about, talk about, and sell amaro with confidence. Cheers ðŸ¥ƒ"
