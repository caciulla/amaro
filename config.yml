              Content: "Hello, the goal of this site is to offer employees of the service industry a brief introductionâ€”or quick refresherâ€”on the world of amaro. This is not meant to be a comprehensive guide. It is my hope to create something that can serve as a quick, ten-minute crash course that will help anyone in the service industry, learn about, talk about, and sell amaro with confidence. Cheers ðŸ¥ƒ"
