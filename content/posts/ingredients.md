### Common bittering ingredients:

The main characteristic that distinguishes amaro from all other liqueurs is its bitterness, as the name implies. Throughout evolution human bodies have grown a sort of alarm system to react to bitter ingredients. This is because, unlike sweet and salty things, bitter is often indictative of toxicity in a plant. 

Many bitter plants are not poisonous. In fact, they often possess strong medicinal qualities. Bitter agents have been used for centuries to treat a range of medical conditions.
> <sp>For example: Cinchona bark has been used for centuries to treat malaria. It's also been used to treat: muscle cramps, bloating, loss of appetite, fever, the flu, colds, enlarged spleen, varicose veins, and some types of cancer.</sp>


The 'alarm effect' is actually your body's attempt to speed up the process of digestion in order to expel the potentially toxic plant. This produces an array of beneficial effect, including the production of bile, mucous, saliva, and gastric juice secretion.

* Some Amari are made using wine as a base. Others are made from neutral spirit. Still
others are made from a grape distillate.

    * Neutral spirit - also called rectified spirit, is produced by repeated distillation (or
rectification) until achieving almost pure alcohol (95% in US) topped at 97.2% by
process.

    *  Grape distillate - high proof alcohol produced by distilling grape must and/or
pomace. Grape juice + aging = brandy. Grape pomace + must = grappa.
*Repeated distillation achieves grape based neutral spirit.
