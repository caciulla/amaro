● Some Amari are made using wine as a base. Others are made from neutral spirit. Still
others are made from a grape distillate.

○ Neutral spirit - also called rectified spirit, is produced by repeated distillation (or
rectification) until achieving almost pure alcohol (95% in US) topped at 97.2% by
process.

○ Grape distillate - high proof alcohol produced by distilling grape must and/or
pomace. Grape juice + aging = brandy. Grape pomace + must = grappa.
Repeated distillation achieves grape based neutral spirit.
