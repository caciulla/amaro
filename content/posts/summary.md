Amaro is a complex group of beverages, which is what many find so appealing. The lack of regulation means that there is very few limitations, which gives producters free reign to do whatever the want. 
> side note: in the last decade many producers of amari have emerged in the United States, each experimenting with the ancient ingredients in unique and creative ways, sometimes to the lamentation of Italian traditionalists.

This means that, unlike whiskey or vodka where the flavor profile is fairly universal, amari flavor profiles vary considerably from one to the next. No amount of writing and reading will suffice, the only way to experience an amaro is to taste it.

When I have a guest at my bar, I like to start them with a nice beginner's Amari, something entry level and relatively sweet like Amaro Nonino, then a standard like Averna, leading into something a bit more challenging like Braulio, and then finish off with a fernet like Luxardo.

Taking my guests on this herbal tour of Italy lets me show how broad this little catagory of bitter beverages can be. From dark and strong to light with notes of caramel and citrus, I like to take my guest on a bit of a ride.

And really, the best part about amaro is the experiences. The fun part is getting out there, finding something new, and trying it for yourself!
