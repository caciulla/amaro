Amaro is a complicated group of beverages, which is what many find so appealing. The lack of regulation means that there is very little restiction or limitations. 

This means that, unlike whiskey or vodka where the flavor profile is fairly universal, no matter how much writing and reading you do, the only way to experience an amaro is to taste it.

I like to start people off with a beginners Amaro like cardemaro, then a standard like averna, leading into somethig more challengine like Braulio, and then finish off with a fernet. 

This herbal tour of Italy takes in amaro from all sides and shows how expansive the bitter beverge can be on the palette.

And really, the best part about amaro is its all experiences. The fun is in trying something new.
