Amaro is a complex group of beverages, which is what many find so appealing. The lack of regulation means that there are very few limitations, which gives producers a lot of liberty when it comes to designing their products.

> side note: in the last decade many producers of amari have emerged in the United States, each experimenting with the ancient ingredients in unique and creative ways, sometimes to the lamentation of Italian traditionalists.

This means that, unlike whiskey or vodka where the flavor profile is fairly universal, amari flavor profiles vary considerably from one to the next. No amount of reading will suffice when trying to learn about a new amaro, the only way to experience it is to taste it!

When I have a guest at my bar, I like to start them with a nice beginner's Amari, something entry-level and relatively sweet like Amaro Nonino, then a standard like Averna, leading into something a bit more challenging like Braulio, and then finish off with a fernet like Luxardo.

Taking my guests on this herbal tour of Italy allows me to demonstrate how broad this little category of bitter beverages can be. From light and happy with notes of caramel and citrus to dark and brooding, and even earthy and vegetal, I like to take my guest on a real journey.

And truly, the best part about amaro is the experience. The fun part is getting out there, finding something new, and trying it for yourself!
