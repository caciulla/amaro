Amaro is a loose classification for a group of herbal, bittersweet, aromatic Italian-made liqueurs.

'Amaro' is the Italian word for bitter.  The plural is 'amari.' 

Amari date back hundreds of years in Italy, crafted in monasteries as a medicinal treatment for various ailments.

The basic composition of an amaro recipe includes mascerating herbs, roots, nuts, fruits, berries, bark, and flowers. The mixture is then steeped in alcohol for 3-4 weeks. After the set time has passed and the infusion is complete, the plant matter is filtered out and the alcohol is once again set to age, typically for an additional 2 weeks, though some producers age it for as long as a year.

During the late 19th century amaro had it's golden age. As Italy became unified as one country in 1861 and sugar became readily available due to international trade, the recipes previously protected by the monks were produced and distributed on a global scale.

Though the drink was now available recreational and for sale to the public, the production and recipes became and remain to this day a familty affair. In fact the recipes, including methods and ingredients are guarded and arguably one of the most characteristically defining aspects of the amaro industry.
