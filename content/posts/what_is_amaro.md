Amaro is a loose classification for a group of herbal, bittersweet, aromatic Italian-made liqueurs.

The word 'Amaro' is the Italian word for bitter. The plural is 'amari.'

Amari date back hundreds of years in Italy, crafted in monasteries as medicinal treatments for a variety ailments.

The basic composition of an amaro recipe includes mascerating herbs, roots, nuts, fruits, berries, bark, and flowers. The mixture is then steeped in alcohol for 3-4 weeks. After the set time has passed and the infusion is complete, the plant matter is filtered out and the alcohol is once again set to age, typically for an additional 2 weeks, though some producers age it for as long as a year.

During the late 19th century amaro had it's golden age. As Italy became unified as one country in 1861 and sugar became readily available due to international trade, the recipes previously protected by the monks were produced and distributed on a global scale.

Though the drink became available to a wide public audience, the production methods and recipes remain closely guarded family secrets. In fact even the most popular amari in the world have divulged very few details about their processes. The secretive nature of amari, each one a protected family secret, is arguably one of the most characteristically defining qualities of the amaro industry.
