Amaro is not regulated so there are no strict classifications for different types of amaro. But certain distinctions can be made based on the the ingredients used and the flavor profile of the amaro.
![]()
Most often the term Amaro refers to digestivos although aperitivos also fall into the category.

## Apertivos (aperitif)-

- Brightly colored
- Lower alcohol (11-24%)
- Usually mixed
- Drier, more citrus
- Drunk before meal

## Digestivos (digestif)-

- Darkly colored: amber-onyx
- Higher alcohol (16-40%)
- Typically drunk neat though mixing is also common
- Sweeter than apertivos
- Drunk after meal

Below is an incomplete list of amari types to be used as a guide for discussing and organizing amari.

- Light - light in color and bitterness. Usually low alcohol, hints of caramel, citrus,
  botanical.
  ![]()
- Medium - darker in color. Higher bitterness. Can be more or less sweet depending.
  Overall more powerful flavor profile.
  ![]()
- Carciofo - artichoke Amari. Mild to strong vegetal tones.
  ![]()
- Alpine - produced in northwestern Italy(Lombardy/Piedmont) lighter in body. Less sweet/citrus. More herbal/medicinal.
  ![]()
- Rabarbaro - also from northwest, infused with Chinese rhubarb, native to Italy since the 17th cent. Cloudy, smoky, vegetal, ebony colored, bitter yet sweet, balanced.
  ![]()
- Fernet - very bitter. High alcohol. Thinner bodied. Very medicinal/herbal. Aloe Ferox is
  typical base infusion. Fernet-Branca most well known.
  ![]()
- Apertivos - have their own category of Amari. Usually more bitter than digestifs, brightly colored (orange, red, yellow), high citrus, super dry,
  ![]()
- Vermouth Amaro -,from what I understand, these Amari differentiate from wine based
  Amari in that they are fortified (add alcohol) to a lower proof (12-16%) making it more of
  a vermouth than a typical amaro. This process also makes it necessary to refrigerate.

> Amari producers in Italy argue that in order to be a true amaro it must be from Italy. Though without any formal structure or legal regulation there is nothing preventing manufacturers of bittersweet, alcoholic beverages from other European nations, inculding the United States, from classifying their products as Amaro.

A few examples of arguably amaro beverages from countries outside Italy:
    
    * Chartreuse
    * Jaegermeister
    * Underberg
    * Sauze
    * Malort
