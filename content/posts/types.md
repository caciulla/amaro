Amaro is not regulated so there are no strict classifications for differnt types of amaro. But certain distinctions can be made based on the the ingredients used and the flavor profile of the amaro. Below is an incomplete list of amari types to be used as a guide for discussing and organizing amari. 
![]()
* Light - light in color and bitterness. Usually low alcohol, hints of caramel, citrus,
botanical.
![]()
* Medium - darker in color. Higher bitterness. Can be more or less sweet depending.
Overall more powerful flavor profile.
![]()
* Carciofo - artichoke Amari. Mild to strong vegetal tones.
![]()
* Alpine - produced in northwestern Italy(Lombardy/Piedmont) lighter in body. Less sweet/citrus. More herbal/medicinal.
![]()
* Rabarbaro - also from northwest, infused with Chinese rhubarb, native to Italy since the 17th cent. Cloudy, smoky, vegetal, ebony colored, bitter yet sweet, balanced.
![]()
* Fernet - very bitter. High alcohol. Thinner bodied. Very medicinal/herbal. Aloe Ferox is
typical base infusion. Fernet-Branca most well known.
![]()
* Apertivos - have their own category of Amari. Usually more bitter than digestifs, brightly colored (orange, red, yellow), high citrus, super dry,
![]()
* Vermouth Amaro -,from what I understand, these Amari differentiate from wine based
Amari in that they are fortified (add alcohol) to a lower proof (12-16%) making it more of
a vermouth than a typical amaro. This process also makes it necessary to refrigerate.
